## Description

The project is about a live tracking system of the International Space Station (ISS).
The data is taken from the REST API at https://wheretheiss.at/.
We retrieve the data, store it in a H2 database, with the help of JPA, and present the information in a simple web-UI containing a world map.
All requests made by our clients are logged through Kafka.
